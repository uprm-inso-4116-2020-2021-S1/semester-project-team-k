## Steps
Since generally the node_modules folder (which contains all the packages for a project) is ignored in github (because it contains a lot of packages), you guys will have to install the packages locally. 
So get Node.js if you don't have it for the npm (node package manager),
then access the repo via the Command Prompt,
and do "npm install"
This will install all the packages. You'll have:
- React Native
- Babel (converts modern JS to browse-compatible old JS)
- Expo (like a noob lubricant for starting React Native developers)
- and other less important packages.

To start the local server for the app you can do "npm start" or "expo start" inside the repository folder.
